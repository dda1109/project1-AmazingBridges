Check out the incredible photographs below along with a timeline of the project’s major milestones and notable records and figures.\r\n\r\nBridges are often considered to belong to the realm of the engineer rather than that of the architect. But the architecture of infrastructure has a powerful impact on the environment and the Millau Viaduct, designed in close collaboration with structural engineers, illustrates how the architect can play an integral role in the design of bridges. It follows the Millennium Bridge over the River Thames, in expressing a fascination with the relationships between function, technology and aesthetics in a graceful structural form.\r\n\r\nLocated in southern France, it connects the motorway networks of France and Spain, opening up a direct route from Paris to Barcelona. The bridge crosses the River Tarn, which runs through a spectacular gorge between two high plateaux. Interestingly, alternative readings of the topography suggested two possible structural approaches: to celebrate the act of crossing the river or to articulate the challenge of spanning the 2.46 kilometres from one plateau to the other in the most economical manner. Although historically the river was the geological generator of the landscape, it is very narrow at this point, and so it was the second reading that suggested the most appropriate structural solution.\r\n\r\nA cable-stayed, masted structure, the bridge is delicate, transparent, has the optimum span between columns. Each of its sections spans 342 metres and its columns range in height from 75 metres to 245 metres (equivalent to the height of the Eiffel Tower), with the masts rising a further 90 metres above the road deck. To accommodate the expansion and contraction of the concrete deck, each column splits into two thinner, more flexible columns below the roadway, forming an A-frame above deck level. The tapered form of the columns both expresses their structural loads and minimises their profile in elevation. The bridge not only has a dramatic silhouette, but crucially, it also makes the minimum intervention in the landscape.

The span was originally called the New York and Brooklyn Bridge or the East River Bridge but was officially renamed the Brooklyn Bridge in 1915.\r\n\r\nProposals for a bridge connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn were first made in the early 19th century, which eventually led to the construction of the current span, designed by John A. Roebling. His son Washington Roebling oversaw the construction and contributed further design work, assisted by the latter\'s wife, Emily Warren Roebling. While construction started in 1870, numerous controversies and the novelty of the designed construction process caused the actual construction to be prolonged over thirteen years. Since opening, the Brooklyn Bridge has undergone several reconfigurations, having carried horse-drawn vehicles and elevated railway lines until 1950. To alleviate increasing traffic flows, additional bridges and tunnels were built across the East River.

The bridge is nicknamed "The Coathanger" because of its arch-based design.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of John Bradfield of the New South Wales Department of Public Works, the bridge was designed and built by British firm Dorman Long of Middlesbrough (who based the design on their 1928 Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne) and opened in 1932.] The bridge\'s general design, which Bradfield tasked the NSW Department of Public Works with producing, was a rough copy of the Hell Gate Bridge in New York City. This general design document, however, did not form any part of the request for tender, which remained sufficiently broad as to allow cantilever (Bradfield\'s original preference) and even suspension bridge proposals. The design chosen from the tender responses was original work created by Dorman Long, who leveraged some of the design from their own Tyne Bridge which, though superficially similar, does not share the graceful flares at the ends of each arch which make the harbour bridge so distinctive. It is the sixth longest spanning-arch bridge in the world and the tallest steel arch bridge, measuring 134 m (440 ft) from top to water level. It was also the world\'s widest long-span bridge, at 48.8 m (160 ft) wide, until construction of the new Port Mann Bridge in Vancouver was completed in 2012.\r\n\r\nThe Sydney Harbour Bridge was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 19 March 2007 and to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 June 1999.', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3313.449615230982!2d151.20859841494735!3d-33.852301825633596!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6b12ae5d25ead5e3%3A0x68948eb717c0c43e!2zQ-G6p3UgY-G6o25nIFN5ZG5leQ!5e0!3m2!1svi!2s!4v159', 183),

Base of each tower holds machines that lift two parts of the bridge so bridge can allow passing of river traffic beneath it. Tower Bridge is located close to the Tower of London from which it got its name.\r\n\r\nEast End of London reached so high commercial development in the second half of 19th that it demanded one more river crossing. In the 1876, a “Special Bridge or Subway Committee” was formed to find a solution. Some 50 designs were submitted, but because of much controversy, it took eight years for one design to be approved. It was a design submitted by Sir Horace Jones, the City Architect that he designed in collaboration with John Wolfe Barry. Construction began in 1886 and lasted until 1894. Five companies and 432 workers worked on it. It has 70,000 tons of concrete in foundations only and some 10,000 tons of steel and is covered in Cornish granite and Portland stone as means of protection for steel structure and as an esthetic element. Victorian Gothic style is used to esthetically integrate Tower Bridge with nearby Tower of London. Prince and Princess of Wales officially opened the bridge on 30th of June 1894. The bridge connected Horselydown Lane, today Tower Bridge Road, with Iron Gate, today Tower Bridge Approach.\r\n\r\nThe bridge is close to the harbor so it was necessary for it to be made in a way that it can allow passing of ships. Machines that lift bascules were hydraulic steam machines until 1974 when they were replaced with electro-hydraulic drive system. Some of the old steam machines are left as a tourist attraction and is a part of the museum tour of a Tower Bridge.\r\n\r\nTower Bridge is still in function and is still a major crossing of the Thames. Daily, some 40,000 people cross it in both directions. While it was controlled manually from the beginning, in 2000, a computer controls system was installed so bascules could be raised and lowered remotely. Bascules are raised around 3 times a day and a 24 hours\' notice is needed from a ship that needs pass.\r\n\r\nAfter they were closed in 1910, walkways were reopened in 1982 as a part of a Tower Bridge Exhibition. The Exhibition shows photos, displays and films to tell a history of Tower Bridge and is housed in bridge’s towers, walkways of the bridge and in Victorian engine rooms.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, Bridge Tower entered renovations that lasted four years.

For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river. Over time, some of its stone blocks were looted, and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination. It underwent a series of renovations between the 18th and 21st centuries, commissioned by the local authorities and the French state, which culminated in 2000 with the opening of a new visitor centre and the removal of traffic and buildings from the bridge and the area immediately around it.

It is the oldest bridge in Venice and still in use.\r\n\r\nFirst bridge on that place was Ponte della Moneta, named for mint that grew at one of its entrances. It was built in 1181 and it was a pontoon bridge built on ships and designed by Nicolò Barattieri. Pontoon bridge was replaced in 1255 with a wooden bridge because nearby Realto market increased traffic over it. That bridge had two ramps on each side and a movable platform in the middle that could be raised to allow passing of the ships underneath the bridge. It also had two rows of shops built whose renting and taxes helped maintain the bridge in working order. Because it was close to Realto market, in time it changed the name into Realto Bridge. Maintenance of the bridge was a problem because of the material that was used for its construction.\r\n\r\nDuring the revolt led by Bajamonte Tiepolo in 1310 the bridge was damaged by fire and it collapsed first time in 1444 under the weight of crowd that gathered to watch boat parade in celebration of wedding of the marquis Ferrara. It was rebuilt as a drawbridge but it collapsed once again in 1524. After that it was decided to rebuild the bridge in stone.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1551, authorities requested ideas for design of the stone bridge on the same place, some of the most famous architects of that time answered the call with their ideas. Some of the architects that applied were Vignola, Palladio and even Michelangelo. Problem with their ideas was that they all designed bridges with several arches, which would hinder the river traffic so they were all rejected. Single span design by Antonio da Ponte, Swiss-born Venetian architect and engineer, was approved and construction began in 1588. It lasted until 1591. The bridge that stands today still, was designed like the bridge from 1255. It has two inclined ramps with stairs that lead to central portico, has shops on both sides and three walkways. Single span allows for easy passing of ships. Although doubted that it would last because of its brave design Rialto Bridge stands the test of time and is still one of the main attractions of Venice.', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2799.5791573792553!2d12.333709315024903!3d45.43798417910069!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x477eb1c7faa33a3b%3A0x732011a1298ecc89!2zQ-G6p3UgUmlhbHRv!5e0!3m2!1svi!2s!4v1596077152966!', 240),

It connects San Francisco with Marin County and it is 2737 meters long and 227 meters high. Some 45 million of vehicles cross Golden Gate Bridge in a year. Golden Gate Bridge is one of the landmarks of San Francisco and, until 1964, it was a bridge with longest suspension bridge main span in the world.\r\n\r\nBefore Golden Gate Bridge was built, the shortest route between San Francisco and the Marin County was by ship. First ferry service was established in 1820. In time automobile ferries, which were once used only by costumers of the railroad, became very profitable and San Francisco became largest city in United States largely supplied by ferries. Because the ferries didn’t provide constant connection with the nearby regions, the city’s growth began to drop.\r\n\r\nThen appeared the idea of the bridge that would span the Golden Gate and give San Francisco much-needed link. In 1916, James Wilkins wrote an article in San Francisco Bulletin that estimated cost of building a bridge across Golden Gate is $100 million and asked a question whether it could be done for less. One Joseph Strauss responded with the idea that cantilever bridge could be made for $17 million. Local authorities agreed to expand on the idea but only if design is changed to suspension bridge and if Strauss cooperates with other designers and engineers because of his low experience with jobs of such type and magnitude. Designer Leon Moisseiff and Senior engineer Charles Alton Ellis were joined to the project on the general engineering while Irving Morrow designed look of towers, lightning and Art Deco details of the bridge. Construction of the bridge started in 1933 and ended in 1937. It is not known how many workers worked on the bridge but it was built by some 10 prime contractors, it cost some $35 million, it was finished before the schedule and $1.3 million under budget. Deck has a weight of 1500.000 tonnes and cables that hold it are 90cm thick and made from 130.000 kilometers of wire.\r\n\r\nWhen it was opened on May 27, 1937, opening celebrations lasted a week. The day before bridge was opened for vehicles some 200.000 pedestrian crossed it by foot. For a 50th anniversary, bridge was close again and pedestrians were allowed on it. But this time some 1.000.000 people gathered and caused the middle of the bridge to flatten out. Because of that pedestrian walk was not allowed for a 75th anniversary.\r\n\r\nGolden Gate Bridge is considered one of the most beautiful bridges in the world and is a true feat of engineering of its time. It was built on a fault line that presents constant danger of earthquakes. Strong winds from Pacific can sway the bridge but it is built so it can swing sideways 8 meters and withstand blows of wind that are up to 160 km/h.', 'https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d3151.724019518842!2d-122.48044378516482!3d37.81993281733395!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x808586deffffffc3%3A0xcded139783705509!2zQ-G6p3UgQ-G7lW5nIFbDoG5n!5e0!3m2!1svi!2s!4v159617', 300),

It spans the Cendere Çayı (Chabinas Creek), a tributary of Kâhta Creek, on provincial road 02-03 from Kâhta to Sincik in Adıyaman Province. This bridge was described and pictured in 1883 by archeologists Osman Hamdi Bey and Osgan Efendi.\r\n\r\nThe bridge is constructed as a simple, unadorned, single arch on two rocks at the narrowest point of the creek. At 34.2 m (112 ft) clear span, the structure is quite possibly the second largest extant Roman arch bridge. It is 120 m (390 ft) long and 7 m (23 ft) wide.\r\n\r\nRoadway flanked by ancient columns\r\nThe bridge was rebuilt by the Legio XVI Gallica, garrisoned in the ancient city of Samosata (today Samsat) to begin a war with Parthia. Commagenean cities built four Corinthian columns on the bridge, in honor of the Roman Emperor Lucius Septimius Severus (193–211), his second wife Julia Domna, and their sons Caracalla and Publius Septimius Geta as stated on the inscription in Latin on the bridge.[3] Two columns on the Kâhta side are dedicated to Septimius Severus himself and his wife, and two more on the Sincik side are dedicated to Caracalla and Geta, all in 9–10 m in height. Geta\'s column, however, was removed after his assassination by his brother Caracalla, who damned Geta\'s memory and ordered his name to be removed from all inscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe Severan Bridge is situated within one of the most important national parks in Turkey, which contains Nemrut Dağı with the famous remains of Commagene civilization on top, declared as World Cultural Heritage site by UNESCO.
